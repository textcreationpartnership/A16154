         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am not able to expreſſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation which I haue to you, by reaſon of the Commandement which you vouchſafed to lay vppon me; which yet notwithſtanding is both ſweet and ſharpe. Sweete, in regard that it comes from you, whom I doe ſo highly honour, as well in regard of the eminent quality which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21123:4"/> you hold in the Church of God, as by reaſon of your rare vertues, and beſides for that you are pleaſed to loue me cordially, and more then I ſhall euer be able to deſerue. But yet ſharpe withall, becauſe it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a complaynt with it, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a moſt bitter roote, which hath ſprowted forth, and produced in the heart of many ſome little averſion from Priviledged perſons, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men; and which hath filled the mindes of many with a kinde of ſharpneſſe, and euen of contempt, and hate againſt them. Yea the matter is paſt on ſo farre, that many of them haue armed themſelues, with a certayne fervour and zeale, and haue put themſelues into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, againſt thoſe other, as againſt the enemies of their perſons, or at leaſt, as againſt the enemies of their authoritie, their power, and their greatneſſe. And yet certainly it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21123:4"/> ſeemes, it would haue beene more honourable, euen to fight for them, as for their Children, to protect them as their Orphanes, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pills, to haue ſet vppon the Wolfe who threatned them, being their ſheepe, rather then to haue beaten them themſelues; for hauing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a little ſtrayed from the reſt of the flocke, if yet indeede they haue ſtrayed at all. Alas, it will not be vnfitly done to feare, that the ſame<note place="margin">Serm. 157.</note> which the great <hi>Chryſologus</hi> ſayth of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> may alſo be ſayd of many others: <hi>Per zelum legis, legem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnabat, &amp; in Deum, Dej amore pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabat.</hi> I pray God of his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to defend vs from this great miſery, for it is one of the moſt permitious and irremediable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes of all others, if a man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading himſelfe that he ſeeketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God, doe yet indeede vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that beleefe, ſeeke himſelfe, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21123:5"/> ſuffer himſelfe to be tranſported by ſome paſſion, for ſuch a one is a kind of incorrigible man, and whilſt hee thinketh to merit much, he looſeth all: <hi>Qui errat, quo magis progreditur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sene.</note> 
               <hi>eó magis errat, profectus ejus, defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now ſince it hath pleaſed you to tell me, that many of our Lords the Prelates of <hi>France,</hi> haue this firme beleefe, that Priviledged and Religious men, haue as it were, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt their authority; and deſire to abaſe and weaken their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, to rayſe vp and ſtrengthen their owne Priviledges, vpon the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution and ruyne of Epiſcopall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers; I will not ſpeake to you, as to you; but I will doe it to you as to them; or rather (if it pleaſe you) I will doe it by you to them; but yet with ſo great reſpect, and by way of diſcourſe ſo full of honour, of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and of truth, that God willing,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21123:5"/> no man ſhall haue juſt cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint by it. And to the end that this good fortune may happen to me, and that God may inſpire me with his grace, I doe in mine owne heart, deſire your holy and paternall Benediction.</p>
            <p>I demaund not of you (for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular which I haue in hand) any grace or fauour, nor the ſweete effects of your friendſhip; nor any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, but meere juſtice, yea and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen rigour, if you will (ſauing that you being ſo good, can hardly be rigorous to any) and that you may make no account of my reaſons, but according to the true value of them; and by the juſt weight of a minde which is not pre-occupated, or poſſeſſed by any contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: nor wrapped vp in certaine jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, and vntrue reports; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the falſe fire of paſſion, which may be ouer-caſt with zeale;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21123:6"/> nor yet pricked on by any diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but of a minde intirely free, from all theſe things; and which weigheth reaſon by the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Sanctuary; and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the whole buſineſſe, as in the preſence of God; and as being to render an account to the Divine Majeſty, of all his actions; for the true way of treating well the affaires of God, is to treate them ſo, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to ſuch affaires; and to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh from thence all kinde of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane intereſt, and all that which may ſauour any way of earth.</p>
            <p>But now, before I will plunge my ſelfe more deepely into this ſea, which is toſſed by ſo many windes, and into the handling of this truth, which is oppoſed by ſo many men, it commeth into my thought, that I muſt here doe that, which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently remarked by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to haue beene done, by thoſe Primitiue
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21123:6"/> Chriſtians, when they were perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much; for their enemies cauſed the God of the Chriſtians to be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, after a very ſtrange and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner: for it was in the figure of a man, appareled with a large looſe garment, full of Majeſtie, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the toppe whereof, as vpon the ſhoulders, the head of an Aſſe was put, with a booke in his hand. The feete which did appeare vnder the fringe of his Robe, had vppon them theſe Wordes, which were written in letters of gold, <hi>Deus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cadeaux.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſtianorum Ononychites.</hi> Now vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this ground the Pagans build ſtrong diſcourſes, in prejudice of God and of truth; and made the Church ſo ridiculous, and did ſo diſadvantage the faith of Chriſt, that it was not poſſible to do it more: <hi>Vidimus in foro</hi> (ſayth <hi>Tertullian) &amp; riſimus, &amp; formam, &amp; nomen. Quod colimus nos, Deus vnus eſt.</hi> But yet
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21123:7"/> me thinkes (ſaith he) it is but reaſon, that it ſhould firſt bee vnderſtood, whether indeede we doe adore that fantaſticall thing, or no; and men ſhould firſt be agreed vpon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in fact, before they ſhould put their wits into ſuch a full carriere, and giue themſelues law and liberty to ſay that which is ſayd; and indeede all that to which they haue a minde, tearing in peeces that white and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Robe of Truth. It is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be feared, leaſt the paſſion of ſome particuler men, may haue chalked out, and framed ſome very deformed face, for the repreſenting of this particular, which we haue in hand; and for the ſhewing it forth in ill poſture, and with an aſpect of great diſadvantage, and ſetting it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in a falſe light. They ſay, that theſe Priviledged perſons haue a minde to oppreſſe the authority of our Lords the Prelates, that they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21123:7"/> deſtroy the Hierarchy of the Church, that they inveſt the authority which was eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles, that they are tyed too cloſe vpon the Pope (and of this for-ſooth, they make a mortall ſinne) that they exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues aboue Biſhops; that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the care of Pariſhes, and draw all to themſelues; that they abuſe their Priviledges, and become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, and too independant vppon their Ordinaries; that they deſpiſe Eccleſiaſticall Parſons and Curats, whom they vndermine; that they follow not the Maximes of the Country, and the Priviledges of the <hi>Gallian</hi> Church, that they fill the beſt Chayres of the Kingdome, and in fine, that they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues petty Kings. Having thus made up this Picture, and given ſuch a colouring to it (as is uſed by the great <hi>Baſſaw,</hi> who ordinarily makes all his, full of night, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21123:8"/> deepe ſhadowes and darkeneſſe) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving I ſay framed the face of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, after this manner, they put men then, into an Alarum, they cry out and Preach, yea and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in many places; they print Bookes, and they doe wonders. What, ſay they, is it fit that men band themſelues thus againſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops? is it fit to put the Church in Sciſme? that poore Religious men ſhould be ſo full of obſtinacy and ambition? that without puniſhment they ſhould bring confuſion unto that order, which hath beene eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by our Predeceſſours, and a World of ſuch diſcourſes as theſe, which are received and beleeved as Oracles, and indubitable truths. I wil therfore ſay with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to ſuch as ſhall haue figured or rather diſ-figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us in this faſhion, before the eyes of my Lords the Prelates, that firſt they ſhould in earneſt ſtriue to know,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21123:8"/> whether that be true or no, whether or no we adore this Orient Sun, and this intereſt of our owne, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our deſignes and pretences aime at that. For otherwaies it is to frame an ougly thing at pleaſure, and it is like ſetting up a Quintaine or ſome man of wood, ſo to learne to make thruſts of the Launce, and of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage at it, when yet in the meane time all this is done with diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to the ſervice and glory of God? Wee men ſhould firſt ſeeke to know whether indeede it bee the Arke of truth, or elſe the Cheſt or Coffer of our owne intereſt, which wee adore, and then afterward they might cry out at eaſe, and without danger of errour.</p>
            <p>My Lords, in ſuch a buſineſſe as this, a man may eyther ſeeke the ſole Glorie of GOD, and the good of ſoules which are bathed in the blood of Ieſus
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21123:9"/> Chriſt, who is the true Biſhop and Paſtor of our ſoules, or elſe hee may follow a paſſion, being over-caſt and gilt with a ſhewe of zeale, and ſet foorth with the apparant ornaments of vertue; or elſe in fine, hee may giue himſelfe way to bee perſwaded to certayne things, which hee takes indeede to be very true, though yet in very truth they be not ſo. Of you my Lords I beleeue that it is the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which puts you on; or at the moſt, that it is the firſt, and the third; you having perhaps, given beleefe to ſo many diſcourſes; where with men may haue deſired to flatter you; and perhaps to worke and make deepe impreſſions upon your minds. But yet withall. I beſeech you ſuffer me to tell you that, which generally is in the beleefe of men; namely, that many who are not Biſhops, haue ſuffered themſelues to be tranſported into the ſecond errour, and haue
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21123:9"/> taken paſſion, intereſt, and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, for direct inſpirations: but veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am in feare, leaſt God ſhould ſay, <hi>Non mittebam Prophetas, &amp;</hi>

            <p>Now therefore to diſcerne who is inſpired by God, and who is put on by an Epiſcopall and Apoſtolicall ſpirit, and who on the other ſide is poſeſſed by paſſion, I know not how it may be done more Divinely, then by the mouth of God, and by the mouth of three of the greateſt perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, who haue ever beene in this World; and who all three were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, according to the verie heart, and guſt of God.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Moſes,</hi> that father of the people of God (and as it were their Biſhop) under whom <hi>Ioſua</hi> was placed. It hapned therefore, that one <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad,</hi> who being a part from the multitude of the Iewes,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21123:10"/> (and ſome will ſay perhaps that this is a figure of Religious men) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to prophecy amongſt the people, that is to ſay, to inſtruct, and Preach to them.

It is true, that I haue bin told many times, but I put not this eyther into my booke of receites, or of expences, as a thing which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes me not.

Beſides that the holy Cardinall did neuer giue ouer, euen till the end of his life, to ſerue himſelfe of Religious men, and to imploy them vppon the conduct of his ſoule; and you may well beleeue of ſo great a Cardinall, that ſince hee truſted his conſcience, and his heart in the hands of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, hee might alſo well truſt the reſt, his flocke, and whatſoeuer was in his Dioceſſe, which was the honour of Dioceſſes.</p>

And ſeeing that hee had all in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, he would not commit himſelfe wholy to any; nor put himſelfe into parallel with other folkes; and to the end, that all might be good children to him, hee was a louing Father to all. His life doth further relate, that he had often in his mouth, that word of the wiſeman. <hi>Diſcurre, feſtina, ſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>

Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they debate about hauing the upper end of the board, and to be ſeated in the places of moſt honour? Is it, that they Preach whether they will or no, or in their Dioceſes; and that they make themſelues little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narches in the Empire of others? Doth any one of them heare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions without their conſent, or at leaſt, of their Vicars generall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

If theſe Religious be vulgar perſons, men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe them: If there bee never ſo little in them which is more eminent, men enter into jealouſies, and ſay. There is no remedy, but theſe men muſt be humbled. In fine, what is that which they doe whereby indeede the great power of the Prelates of the Church, is abaſed? Is it, that they haue too many Priviledges, and too great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to abſolue ſinnes? Is it that they take Confeſſions within fifteene dayes of Eaſter, and Miniſter the Communion excepting onely vpon Eaſter day, which the Canons, and the Councells haue excepted? Is it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21123:56"/> that men viſite not the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Churches, and that men enter not upon taking conziance of their Regularity?

There was not in that time, either Confeſſion, or halfe Confeſſion. And as for making a Prophecie thereof, that conceite would haue no garbe in it; eſpecially concerning a thing impoſſible, or at leaſt unprofitable, as I ſhall make you touch with your hands. The true literall ſence of the place is this. The wiſe man ſpeaketh indeede of ſheepe, and it is as much as if hee had ſayd: Although thou be very rich, yet haue thou care of little
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:21123:73"/> things; ſuch as ſheepe are. <hi>Non enim</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>habebis jugiter potestatem:</hi>

A little lower I will giue one or two litterall ſences, which carry propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this. But one good Author will be found, who maketh this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſay litterally, that which men pretend againſt Priviledged perſons. And you ſee well, that following a litterall ſence, there is no colour to underſtand it of Confeſſion.

                  <p n="5">5. But now though wee put the caſe, that this paſſage may ſerue for this purpoſe, yet ſhall it bee either impoſſible to be practiſed, or in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect without any profit at all. For Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is a Paſtour, if ever there were any in the world, and Pope, and the Biſhop, and Parſon. This ſheep is the ſonne and ſubject of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Let us not ſpeake yet of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but onely of the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Cognoſce vultum pecoris tui.</hi> Is there any Parſon or Curate in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> who knoweth the face of all his pariſhioners which are daily changed. Is there any Biſhop that preſumes to ſay that he knowes the face of all who are in his Dioceſes? (For that the Pope ſhould know all Chriſtians, is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21123:74"/> a moſt ridiculous thing.) Cardinall <hi>ellarmine</hi> of holy memory, was often heard to ſay to the moſt illuſtrious Cardinall of <hi>Roche-foveault, Monſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nore, veramente ciſono troppo Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani al mondo.</hi> I aſſure you, ſaith he, that I am oppreſt with reſort of men, and with viſites; and I muſt needes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow to you, that mee thinkes there are to many Chriſtians in the world. For what meanes can a man haue to know, to ſerue, and to content them all? And yet nevertheleſſe this man was no more then an Arch-biſhop, and did but ſpeake of meere viſites.</p>
                  <p>And now doe but imagine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great Arch-biſhop can know the face of all his ſheepe, and yet if hee could, to what would that ſerue for the good of their ſoules?</p>
                  <p>If now you will take theſe wordes, to know the face of your ſheepe, for the condition and ſtate of the heart, and of the conſcience, this is yet far
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:21123:75"/> worſe: For would you haue the Pope confeſſe all the Chriſtians in the World, or the Biſhop all the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of his people, or the Paſtors and Curates all their Pariſhoners? Though they had a hundred heades a peece, they were not able to doe it, and if men were forced to undergoe this burthen, no man living would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a Parſon or a Biſhop, or a Pope.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But let us put the caſe that all this could bee done, for what yet I beſeech you would it ſerue? For that which a man knoweth in Confeſſion, is juſt as much if hee knew it not at all, and all Lawes and rights both divine and humane, doe forbid the <hi>Confeſſarius</hi> to violate the ſecret of Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Clement</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden the Superiours of Religious men to take the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their ſheepe or ſubjects; and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21123:75"/> that yet, if they ſhould take them, they may not without Sacriledge ſerue themſelues of that knowledge which grew to them by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. And now what kinde of knowledge is that which ſerues for nothing? Would the Holy Ghoſt oblige us to haue ſuch a knowledge of our ſheepe as whereof it ſhould forbid us to make any uſe at all: And who would ever confeſſe himſelfe to you, if hee beleeved that you would ever ſerue your ſelfe of the knowledg of what hee told you? The moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctors themſelues, and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> teach that if the Penitent did aſſuredly beleeue that his <hi>Confeſſarius</hi> would reveale his<note place="margin">S. <hi>Tho. in</hi> 4. <hi>d.</hi> 17. <hi>q:</hi> 3. <hi>art.</hi> 3: <hi>major. ibid. q. 5.</hi>
                     </note> Confeſſion, hee ſhould not be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to confeſſe to him; for what then would this precept ſerue of knowing the face of the Sheepe? And I aske you, if of themſelues they would willingly go to confeſſe to a man, who
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21123:76"/> they beleeved would ſerue themſelues of the knowledge of their ſinnes for their owne turne?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. What then is the meaning of theſe words to know their ſheepe? Is it to ordayne ſome man to take their Confeſſions by and under your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? Even in conſcience doe you beleeue that this is to know? In ſome Pariſh of <hi>Paris</hi> there bee many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſoules, and more then a hundred men who wil haue beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to take confeſſions. What knowledge will the Parſon or Curate haue obtained of his ſheep for al that? Theſe good men who were inabled to take confeſſions, will haue ſpent themſelues euen to death with labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in it the whole day, and wil haue gotten ſome cruell head-ache by it, will not remember the thouſand part of that which men haue confeſſed to them, and for what then will it ſerue their turne, and what knowledge
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21123:76"/> will the Parſon or Vicar draw from thence? will they goe tell him what hath beene Confeſſed to them? they will be farre from any ſuch thought, and though they would, they cannot. Beſides, the Penitent is not bound to tell his name, nor who he is. And beſides, if he ſhould declare it vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Tho. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſ.</hi> 15. <hi>c. 4.</hi>
                     </note> how ſhall he be conuinced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? If hee Confeſſe himſelfe eight dayes before, and doe but reconcile himſelfe on Eaſter day, how will you know the face of that ſheepe? If hee haue no mortall ſinne in his ſoule, and that he will not then Confeſſe himſelfe at all, how will you ſtill come to knowe him? I aſſure you that when I found the bottome of this buſineſſe, I find reaſon to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, that ſuch a noyſe is made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſuch a paſſage; and which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in effect nothing leſſe then that which is giuen out.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For if to know, bee to depute
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:21123:77"/> ſome one who may know; O then, all is loſt for them. For if the Pope, and if the Biſhop can appoint whom hee liſts for that purpoſe as well or better then the Parſon or Vicar, behold then the gate is open for all Religious men, and the cauſe is gained. For to ſay, that the Parſon may do it, and that neither the Biſhop, nor the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Parſons, the Father of Biſhops, the Vicar of Ieſus Chriſt may not do it, this is cleerely againſt common ſence, againſt more then twenty Popes, againſt the ſwift current of the Church, againſt two Generall Councels at the leaſt, and againſt a hundred Doctors of great reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And when a man ſhould ſay that the Paſtor at the Communion knoweth the face of his ſheepe; and that the Canons therefore ordaine, that they onely ſhould miniſter the Communion to them, and that they do thereby ſufficiently comply with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21123:77"/> the ſayd paſſage, <hi>Cognoſce vultum,</hi>

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what would they be able to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge againſt it, which might ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. For one Doctor whom they ſhall produce, we will produce twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and it is well enough knowne, that the true literall ſence of theſe words doth import no more, but that Princes ſhould bee true Paſtors of their people; or houſe-keepers of their family, and domeſtickes: and at the moſt it teacheth them, that the way to make a family great, is to haue great flockes of ſheepe, which is the moſt harmeleſſe meanes of growing very rich, and that very ſoone. As for the reſt, they are but morall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and good wits will draw forth as many of them as they liſt, and they may ſerue for the inſtruction of mans life. But that this ſhould import a Commandement touching Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Confeſſions at Eaſter, and be a text of ſo much aduantage for
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21123:78"/> Paſtors; verily that I may not ſay any thing which ſauoureth neuer ſo little of ſharpeneſſe, it doth much amaze ſuch men as are of good vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and voide of intereſt.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To ſay, <hi>that he ſhould knowe them,</hi> that ſo he may conduct them, as is fit, this indeede were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but what conduct will you be able to giue a man, who may come to you in a preſſe of people, at eleauen of the clocke vpon Eaſter day in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and whom afterward you ſhall not ſee in a twelue moneth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture neuer more, for hee may change his pariſh.

                  <p n="12">12. Now I oppoſe againſt this man, twenty Popes at leaſt, who
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:21123:81"/> in expreſſe tearmes haue diſavowed this Gloſſe, as namely <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth, <hi>Alexander</hi> the fourth, <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the fourth, <hi>Martin</hi> the fourth, <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, <hi>Bennet</hi> the elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth, <hi>Iohn</hi> the twenty two, <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth, <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> the fifth, <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. <hi>Paul</hi> the third, <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, <hi>Gregorie</hi> the thirteenth, <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth, <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth, <hi>Gregorie</hi> the fifteenth.

For all theſe in expreſſe, preciſe, and formall tearmes ſhewe the direct contrary, as may bee ſeene by their ſeverall Buls.</p>
                  <p>I oppoſe alſo amongſt others, two generall Councels, that of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1311. where <hi>Phillip</hi> the Fayre, King of <hi>France,</hi> did aſſiſt to honour it with
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21123:82"/> his preſence, and liked well of that which was there agreed; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of <hi>Lateran,</hi> where the Popes, <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. made expreſſe Bulls to declare the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that the Mendicant Prieſts who were Religious, and ſhould be aurhorized by the Pope, might ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely heare Confeſſions, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ever charity, the authority of the ordinaries, and not diminiſhing at all their authority.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame alſo doth the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> affirme. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I oppoſe at leaſt fifty Doctors, greatly learned, and many of them canonized Saints, who doe clearely hold the contrary; and ſhewe that the Canon, <hi>Omnis vtriuſque,</hi> cannot any way hinder Priviledged perſons from hearing Confeſſions, without wrong to any.</p>
                  <p>I oppoſe beſides the conſent of the whole World; for the generall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe

                  <p>I oppoſe yet further the authority of our Kings, and of the Soveraigne Courts of Iuſtice of the Realme, who haue received Regulars, and haue beene pleaſed that they ſhould enjoy their priviledges, and haue main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned them therein; and haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelues of them, and with good ſucceſſe.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21123:83"/> Sapientium.</hi> And in effect all Kings, and aboue them all, our owne, who are the very Sonnes of Kings, and the Flower de Luces of the World, haue proceeded thus.</p>
                  <p>I oppoſe withall the judgement of many wiſe, learned, and moſt vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parſons and Vicars, who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues haue exhorted their Pariſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to confeſſe themſelues to good Regulars, where they beleeue, that they may bee better aſſiſted for the ſalvation of their ſoules. For every one of them ſayth, and ſayth truely, what doth this import me, ſo that my flocke be ſaved? for my part I am ſo much the more diſcharged, who haue, God helpe me, other worke enough to doe. May not I be ſecure in point of conſcience, ſince the Pope, the Councells, ſo many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, ſo many Saints aſſure me that I am diſcharged? Beſides that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue that the beſt Pariſhoners, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21123:83"/> they who frequent my pariſh moſt, and who honour mee the moſt, are they who haue their ſoules beſt cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated with vertue; and make moſt account of devotion. Provided that I know they be well Confeſſed, this ought to ſerue my turne. Beſides a great ſcruple which I haue uppon my ſoule, is the feare I am in, leſt they whoſe Confeſſions I apply my ſelfe to heare, may perhaps not worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquit themſelues, and the fault thereof fall uppon mee, and now I am delivered of this remorſe when they goe to a place, where morrally I ought to bee aſſured that I am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in the ſight of God. Muſt then ſuch a noyſe be made for a little intereſt, or for a little ayre of honor, and for a certaine, I know not what, which is not worth the ſpeaking of? Now I haue heard this very language ſpoken in <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelfe, and that by the principall Parſons and Vicars of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:21123:84"/> the Towne, men of vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and who haue a very great care of the true Hierarchy of the Church, and to ſaue their ſheepe, and to performe their Office exactly well. What ſhall I ſay to you of that noble Chancellour of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Paris?</hi> Though formerly hee had beene a little too ſtiffe and warme in the buſineſſe, yet he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe better afterwards, and ſayd, <hi>Status Curatorum debet cum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21123:84"/> to Religious men, or elſe, ſayth <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> the Parſons and Vicars haue beene much to blame in oppoſing themſelues to them, who haue bin ſo well, ſo juſtifiably, and ſo ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authorized and maintained in their priviledges.</p>
                  <p>Finally, I oppoſe the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which is the Parliament of Peeres, and the paragon of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, which hath made two ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne decrees among the reſt, the one in fauour of the <hi>Iacobins,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1505. and in the behalfe of one who was called <hi>Gally,</hi> and the other in fauour of the <hi>Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,</hi> in the yeare 1531. and it went againſt a Councellor of the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelfe, called <hi>Lovys du Bellay,</hi> parſon and Arch-prieſt of Saint <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verine,</hi> and Arch-deacon of <hi>Paris,</hi> who pretended to make Religious men be hindered from hearing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and was directly rejected
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:21123:85"/> from his demaund, and Religious men maintayned in the uſe of their priviledges. This ſufficeth, and I wil ſay nothing of other parliaments, which are wont to honour the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and not to conteſt them.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. So that you ſee worlds, Popes, Councels, Kings, Prelates, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall Synods of <hi>Langres,</hi> 1452. of <hi>Paris</hi> 1557. of <hi>Aix</hi> 1585. of <hi>Chartres</hi> 1526. of <hi>Roan</hi> 1581. of <hi>Troyes</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as that of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> 1582. of <hi>Bourges,</hi> 1584. and before all this, of <hi>Angers</hi> 1291. You ſee the decrees of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> the poſſeſſion of fiue hundreth yeares, the vniuerſall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, Buls, Decrees, Sentences, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, Condemnations of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictors, a whole troupe of Authors, the moſt wiſe Paſtors and Vicars themſelues, the common Dictamen of the Church, the incredible good which arriueth by it, you ſee, I ſay, all
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:21123:85"/> this in fauour of Regulars on the one ſide, and on the other a petty Canon of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> who in fine is not indeede contrary to vs, though he be ſo in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Rendring therefore to my Lords the Prelates that which their quality deſerues, and their vertues require, that which the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> ordaynes, that which uſe, right and cuſtome haue made to paſſe in the nature of a Law, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring parſons and Curates, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them with particular affection, and withall exhorting all devout men to doe honour to their parſons or Curates, to frequent their pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, to pay in all their rights, and yet notwithſtanding hauing thoſe ſo authentical priviledges in their hands and the poſſeſſion of ſo many yeares; why doe men complaine ſo much of poore Religious men, who very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reape no other thing but much
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:21123:86"/> paine and travaile? Oh, no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what it is to be a good <hi>Confeſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> but ſuch a man as is in a very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary exerciſe thereof: Alas, what a huge patience is needfull, what kinde of longanimity, what a condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, what a company of repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt bee endured, how many uncleanneſſes, what hazards, what a company of ill houres? Is there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſo great pleaſure in feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon nothing but the ſinnes of the people, and with Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure Dragons, Vipers, and a milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of bruite beaſts, full of venoime? I doe rather thinke that men ſhould haue pitty of ſuch poore men, then enuy, and giue thankes to theſe poore Martyres and Confeſſours for their paines they ſuffer, rather then to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne them thus, and make warre upon them.</p>
                  <p>Some of my Lords the prelates, haue themſelues beene willing to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:21123:86"/> heare Confeſſions, and they haue done it with great edification, but wee haue knowne of very few, who haue long continued in that courſe; ſo tough, ſo dangerous, and ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weariſome is that buſineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. As for us, if wee were to take our turne in pleading, certainely I would cite no other Canon then that of <hi>Omnis vtriuſque ſexus,</hi> with the Gloſſe of one of our Synodes of <hi>France.</hi> The Text ſayth that a man muſt confeſſe himſelfe to his <hi>Proper Prieſt,</hi> or elſe haue his leaue to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe himſelfe to another. Now, who is this <hi>Proper Prieſt,</hi> who may giue the leaue? Let us heare the Synode of <hi>Langres</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1421. <hi>Ne remaneat aliqua haeſtitatio, quis proprius dicatur Sacerdos, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus prout etiam jura &amp; doctores de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarant, quod Proprius Sacerdos eſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, ejus Legatus, Paenitentiarius, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſanus, &amp; Vicarius Generalis; &amp; ille
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21123:87"/> cui cura ſuae Parochialis Eccleſiae eſt commiſſa.</hi> After this I beſeech you what can more be ſayd?</p>
                  <p n="16">16. There reſteth onely now this complaint, that pariſhes are forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and that conſequently <hi>Priests</hi> ſtudie not; that men goe not to their Sermons; that for ſpite they leaue all; that Religious men deuoure all, and that their Churches ſwell with people, whileſt pariſhes are forſaken to the great contempt of the Hierarchy of the Church. That now few are found who will bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Vicars, eſpecially in Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and therefore Biſhops grow to finde much difficulty in furniſhing their Dioceſes; by meanes whereof all goes to ruine, and ſoules are damned, and yet Biſhops in the meane time are as much obliged in the ſight of God to haue care of their Dioceſes; as the Pope hath of his, and of the Vniverſall Church. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21123:87"/> that <hi>Prieſts</hi> finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues not to bee imployed, and that perſons of quality goe to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelues elſewhere, and that men make no great account of their Sermons, they ſpend not their time in ſtudie; and not ſtuding, they giue themſelues to idleneſſe, and from idleneſſe growes the reſt, in ſuch ſort, that Regulars are the cauſe of theſe miſchiefes, and that ſecular prieſts grow to bee irregular, and it belongeth to Biſhops to redreſſe theſe things, who groane in the meane time under this burthen, and know not how to apply good and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall remedies.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Behold here great ſtore of crimes hudled vp one vpon another, and behold a grieuous mortall ſinne, whereof (by miſchance) the Regulars meane not to confeſſe themſelues to be guilty. And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knowe it not, and they
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:21123:88"/> found themſelues vpon this, that <hi>non entis proprié non eſt ſcientia.</hi> And they make good that they are not the cauſe of theſe miſchiefes in the ſtrength of theſe maximes of Lawe, which is receiued throughout the whole world. <hi>Qui vtitur iure ſuo, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini facit iniuriam.</hi> For what? ſhall it not be lawfull for me to doe well, for feare leaſt others do ill for ſpight? What will you ſay if God haue ſent Religious men into the world, as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus Benedictus</hi> ſaid, to awake them of the Church, who were ſleeping? And certainely theſe are the motiues which Popes aſſigne in their Buls of priuiledges, and which deſerue to be read and well weighed, with a mind full of reſpect and piety. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe diſcouered this to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, when he ſhewed him the Church, as if it had bene falling to the ground, and Saint <hi>Dominicke,</hi> and Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> who ſhouldred it
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:21123:88"/> vp ſo happily, that they kept it on foote, and reſtored it to the former place. But let vs paſſe from this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which yet neuertheleſſe is not impertinent. For conſidering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible good which God hath vouchſafed to worke by meanes of Regulars ouer the whole world, wee haue reaſon to praiſe his infinite goodneſſe, to render him all glory for it, and to hope that they may yet be able to ſerue him in the aſſiſtance of many ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. O how I loue that good and gallant Parſon in <hi>Paris,</hi> whom all you my Lords do alſo loue, and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he deſerues it, who ſayd thus after an Apoſtolicall manner, and with a generous heart. <hi>Let vs do better then Religious men, and beleeue me the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men will be more affraid of vs, then we of them. The world followeth vertue, or the opinion of vertue, or both together: that which we ſhould doe, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:21123:89"/> men ſtriue to doe, but let vs ſtriue to do that which they do, and their Houſes will be more forſaken then ours. Let vs adorne our Churches as they do, let vs make learned and deuoute Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which may greatly edifie our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, let vs liue as we ſpeake, let vs cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuate the ſoules of our Pariſhioners, let vs make choice of Priests of good liues, let all go orderly in our Churches, let vs lay all our intereſts at the feete of the Crucifixe, and this will be the moſt powerfull meanes to defend vs, and to mainetaine vs in our rights, and to haue cauſe to feare nothing. But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to make ſuch a noyſe, and to doe nothing, but cry out without ceaſing, and to toſſe Excommunications vp and downe, and to be ſending threats, all this makes for nothing but diſcourſe without producing any fruit, and mens minds are ſo made, that by this meanes they rather growe wild, then ſoft and ſweete, and reſtored to the way of the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:21123:89"/> antient piety of France.</hi> In fine, this man liueth after this manner, and not onely he, but ſome others alſo, who are adored in their pariſhes; and all men do ſo loue them, and they are ſo deſired, and euen as it were oppreſt with buſineſſe, that men cannot ſee them, but with halfe an eye. And as for thoſe others who are euer cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, they breede more feare then enuy in ſuch as would drawe neere to them; and they eſtrange their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners from them, who beleeue that there is ſome other thing in the buſineſſe then the pure loue of God, the ſaluation of ſoules, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the Hierarchy. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech God to preſerue this moſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Paſtor, and beſtow vpon him a great heape of benedictions, and grant that all the reſt may walke the ſame pace, and doe ſo much good, that Regulars may haue no more to doe. O, in how great repoſe, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:21123:90"/> with how ioyfull a heart would they pray God, for ſo many and ſo worthy labourers?</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Let vs come to that other exception, that Benefices remaine voyde, and that now in effect men doe finde no perſons capable to fill them with, eſpecially in countrey townes and villages. Now here I muſt cleerely auow either my ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, or my too great credulity. For in very truth I was of opinion, that there had not beene halfe a Benefice which enow had not extreamle deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to get, and to heape one vpon another, and that not being able to procure them by any other meanes, men buy them out right with ready money; and that they vſe a thouſand trickes to ſerue one anothers turnes; and that Simony was neuer ſo refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor leſſe apprehended to be ill, and all the reſt of that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fame is ſpreading in all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:21123:90"/> Verily I beleeued all this, and I confeſſe I did it as a thing moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and without all doubt. But, my Lords, ſince you haue told me the contrary (for you haue ſayd it) I will reſolutely giue my minde this law, and I will make it ſtoope to this yoake, that I will beleeue you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction.</p>
                  <p>But, my Lords, you will pardon me if ſtill I tell you, that although I beleeue the thing, yet I cannot force my heart to beleeue the cauſe which is alledged; namely, that Regulars are the cauſe thereof. For how can this be? Is it becauſe they get their Benefices? let them haue no more of them. Is it that they diuert Secular Prieſts from taking thoſe Benefices? excommunicate them. Is it that they carry away all the ſtations or Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences? They haue none but ſuch as pleaſe you, and oftentimes they haue but the refuſe of others. Is it becauſe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:21123:91"/> they debauſh ſecular Prieſts make them bee puniſhed by their ſuperiors; and if they will not, doe it you. Is it becauſe they doe not Counſell them to ſtudie? Alas, ſome times they ſay that the Ieſuites make too many men learned, and too full of knowledge; and ſometimes the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrary. Good God, whom ſhall wee beleeue? If I feared not to offend ſome, and if I had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that I would not anger any, I would acquaint you very clearely with the true ſource of all theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but I had rather leaue it to your thought; and I will impoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſilence uppon my ſelfe, ſaving onely in this that I declare to you clearely with a ſtrong voyce, and with much truth, that it is not good Religious men, who are the cauſe of theſe diſorders.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. So farre of it is, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars ſhould bee the cauſe, that a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:21123:91"/> hundred Biſhops will tell you on the other ſide, when there hath beene ſome diſorder in Bourgs and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they haue ſerved themſelues of Regulars, to put things in Order as before, and the ſucceſſe hath proved, that the choyce was good. This is ſo cleare, that it needes no proofe. Whether this trouble the Order of the Church, whether it bee againſt the authority of Prelates, or againſt the right of Paſtours, or againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I make the moſt reverend <hi>Charles</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Langres,</hi> the Iudge; who in his Synode, after hee had commaunded the publication of that Canon, <hi>Omnis vtriuſque,</hi> ſayth theſe very words. <hi>Nè detur materia fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribus Mendicantibus querelandi, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumus quod in fine publicationis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutionis praedictae, Omnis vtriuſque ſexus, &amp;c. ſubinferatur, &amp; publice, quod per hoc non intendimus praejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care Privilegijs ſuper audiendis Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſionibus,

                  <p>All that which he demaundeth is, that men doe it vnder his authority, and this is done, and it is more then moſt reaſonable that it ſhould be ſo.

For the fatherly prouidence of God hath ſent a new Renforce, by a moſt vertuous congregation of holy Prieſts, who beeing full of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and piety, will ſupply all theſe wants, according to the vocation which God hath giuen them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſecular Clergy. By the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their liues they will ſhew what is to bee done, by their endeauours they will fill ſuch places as ſhalbee voyde, both in City and Countrey, and they will yeeld good labourers will refuſe to take no paines, and will gladly ſpread their Charity ouer the whole World, as they haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die begunne to doe in many places, and will alſo by little and little grow ſubſtituting excellent Eccleſiaſticall

One onely thing I feare, that after men ſhall haue cryed hard againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men, they will alſo beginne to cry out againſt theſe, every one interpreting their zeale according to his owne fancy; and banding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues perhaps as ſtiffely againſt them, as againſt Religious, and alleadging a thouſand things according to their paſſions and humours.</p>
                  <p>Now if this ſhould happen, you would clearely diſcerne even from that inſtant, that the noyſe which is made both againſt the one, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, proceedes from ſome other roote then of meere cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and of a true deſire of the good of the true Hierarchy.</p>
                  <p>To tell you more of this would ſerue for nothing to my purpoſe, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I will ſay franckly, that there will neuer be good labourers enow; that

                     </note> enemies of theſe Orders, was very diſaſtrous; or of one of them at leaſt, who dyed miſerably.</p>
                  <p>In fine, you ſhall haue in Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> all thoſe very arguments which are brought againſt us at this day, with the angelicall and moſt ſolid anſweres of this Oracle, who, at his returne to <hi>Paris,</hi> did publikely

But the people calling up their ſpirits, and conſidering the inſolency of this bold meane fellow, did that, which you may read if it pleaſe you, in the ſtory; for I will not loade this paper with it, nor yet importune you.

You may bee pleaſed to remember that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the ſecond, had employed him extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to appeaſe the Schiſme, and hee did all that which a Saint was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe, who had his hands full of miracles, and was ever able to worke them.</p>
                  <p>But what did the innocent Abbot gaine by this? A thouſand jealouſies roſe up againſt him, a thouſand ſlanders were darted againſt the white of his poore heart; the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a Letter calling him Rebell and Traytor againſt the See Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke. Who would ever haue belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this? Yet in fine, ſo it was. The holy man opening the Popes Letter to him, was as if hee had opened a Cloud full of fire, with a bolt of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the midſt, and with a blow as
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:21123:111"/> if it had pierced his heart. But yet calling his ſpirits to himſelfe, and adoring the admirable but ſecret providences of God, hee wrote in theſe tearmes to the Pope. <hi>Quis mihi faciet iuſtitiam de vobis? Si haberem</hi>

All his choller was ſuch, as that hee had none at all, and his appealing (as for a wrong) was not to appeale at all; but to remit it to the providence of God, to make the truth appeare, and to make his innocency ſubſiſt, which was evidently afterward as you know.</p>
